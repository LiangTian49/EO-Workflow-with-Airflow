# EO-Workflow-with-Airflow

This repository proposes an automated earth observation workflow that generates the Land Cover maps based on Sentinel-2 data using Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms combined with High Performance Computing technology. With the demonstration of Apache Airflow, tasks can be distributed across multiple HPC resources, leading to efficient utilization of available computing resources on the HPC machine.
